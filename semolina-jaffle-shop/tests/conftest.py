"""
Shared pytest fixtures for semolina-jaffle-shop tests.

Provides in-memory DuckDB connection pools pre-loaded with jaffle-shop
fixture data and real ``SEMANTIC VIEW`` definitions. Pools are registered
with semolina so tests call ``Model.query().execute()`` against a real
``semantic_view()`` execution -- aggregation, grouping, ordering, limiting,
and filtering all run for real.

The semantic views are (re)created on every new physical connection via a
SQLAlchemy ``connect`` event. ADBC poolhouse creates independent DuckDB
instances per physical connection (``source.adbc_clone``), so each new
connection must build its own tables and views.
