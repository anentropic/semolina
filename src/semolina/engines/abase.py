"""
Async sibling of the backend ``Engine``.

Defines ``AsyncEngine``, which owns exactly one adbc-poolhouse ``AsyncPool``
plus its derived dialect. ``connect()`` checks an ADBC connection out of the
owned pool; ``aexecute()`` runs the same builder + cursor path the synchronous
engine runs, awaiting adbc-poolhouse's coroutines instead of blocking.

``AsyncEngine`` is a *sibling* of :class:`~semolina.engines.base.Engine`, not a
proxy over one: adbc-poolhouse's ``AsyncPool`` builds its own inner synchronous
pool, so there is nothing to proxy, and one engine owns exactly one pool. The
sync/async choice is fixed by which constructor was called.

Posture A: this module imports neither ``asyncio`` nor ``anyio``. Loop-backend
agnosticism is inherited from adbc-poolhouse, which funnels every blocking ADBC
call through a single thread-offload chokepoint; Semolina only awaits it. That
also means query cancellation reaches the warehouse without a line of
cancellation code here, provided no handler in this module ever swallows a
``BaseException``.

    """
    Async engine owning one adbc-poolhouse ``AsyncPool`` plus its dialect.

    The async counterpart of :class:`~semolina.engines.base.Engine`. It owns
    exactly one ``AsyncPool`` and the :class:`~semolina.engines.sql.Dialect`
    derived from the config type, and it generates SQL with the *same* builder
    the synchronous path uses — there is no second SQL path.

    Unlike ``Engine`` this class is concrete and backend-agnostic: ``introspect``
    is the only method backends specialize, and async introspection is deferred,
    so there are no per-backend async subclasses.

    Async engines are constructed via
    :func:`semolina.config.create_async_engine`, which supplies the pool and
    dialect.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from adbc_poolhouse import DuckDBConfig

            from semolina.config import create_async_engine

            engine = create_async_engine(DuckDBConfig(database=":memory:"))
            async with await engine.aexecute(query) as cursor:
                async for row in cursor:
                    print(row["country"], row["revenue"])
            await engine.dispose()

                ``Any`` because the poolhouse async pool surface is untyped and

        Check an ADBC connection out of the owned async pool.

        The async parallel of :meth:`semolina.engines.base.Engine.connect`, but
        with only **one** sanctioned consumption mode rather than two: the
        **long-lived handle**. Keep the returned connection alive past this call
        and return it to the pool with an explicit ``await conn.close()``.

        The context-manager mode the sync engine also permits is not available
        here. Checking the connection back in while an Arrow reader is still
        live invalidates that reader, and the reader created by
        :class:`~semolina.acursor.AsyncSemolinaCursor` outlives the ``aexecute``
        call by design. :meth:`aexecute` therefore hands the live connection to
        the cursor, which closes it — reader first — in ``aclose()``, and
        ``aexecute`` closes it itself on its own error path so a failed
        ``execute()`` does not leak the slot.

        Unlike the synchronous :meth:`semolina.engines.base.Engine.dispose`
        there is no fallback branch. That branch keys on a marker set on the

        identical on both paths — then checks out a connection, executes the
