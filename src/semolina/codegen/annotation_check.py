"""
Compare a committed model's annotations against the warehouse's current result schema.

This is the engine behind ``semolina codegen --check``. It answers one question per field:
does the annotation sitting in the user's committed model still describe the type that
column arrives as? The authority is the **result schema** — what the driver says the query
will return — resolved by :func:`semolina.codegen.probe.probe_schema`, with the warehouse's
own metadata as a *labelled* fallback (Decision 3, 47-DECISIONS.md).

**Not a byte-diff.** TYPE-07's wording is "still match the warehouse's current *result
schema*". Regenerating the model and diffing the text would compare against the **metadata**
route, which is the route Phase 47 measured as disagreeing with the result schema — so a
byte-diff would answer a different question, and would also flag pure formatting noise.
Per-field comparison against a probed schema is the design; do not "simplify" it back.

**The route is always reported.** A green ``--check`` that silently fell back to warehouse
metadata would be indistinguishable from a probed one, which is false assurance rather than
assurance (threat T-48-24). Every row carries ``execute-schema``, ``zero-row`` or
:data:`ROUTE_METADATA`.

**No row value ever reaches a report.** Rows carry field names, annotation strings, routes
and a status — nothing else. The probe fetches no rows by construction, so no value is even
in scope (threat T-48-22).

The generation path is deliberately untouched by all of this: ``semolina codegen`` still
builds models from warehouse metadata. Making generation probe-primary needs a canonical
query builder, an offline fallback chain and route recording in emitted source; that is
Phase 50's DTO-07/DTO-09 and D-01 defers it explicitly. The accepted consequence is that
generating a model and immediately checking it can legitimately report drift wherever the
two routes still disagree — Phase 47's central finding, surfaced rather than suppressed
(D-02).
