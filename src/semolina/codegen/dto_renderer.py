"""
Render a Pydantic DTO from a query's *probed* result schema.

The counterpart of :mod:`semolina.codegen.python_renderer`, which generates a Semolina model
from warehouse metadata. This one generates a plain ``pydantic.BaseModel`` from the schema
the driver says a specific query will return, so the annotations describe the query's result
rather than the view's declaration (DTO-07).

Three properties are load-bearing and none of them are local decisions:

* **Every annotation comes from** :func:`semolina.codegen.arrow_map.arrow_type_to_python`
  (D-06). Nothing here re-derives an Arrow type. A ``decimal128`` column annotates
  ``decimal.Decimal``, never ``float`` — which is also what Phase 49's ``.into()`` pre-check
  enforces, so re-deriving would let Semolina emit a class Semolina rejects.
* **Fields bind to result columns by name, never by position.** The orders genuinely
  disagree: Snowflake and Databricks return metrics before dimensions, DuckDB's
  ``semantic_view()`` returns dimensions before metrics. A positional rule would be a
  per-backend table wearing a disguise (threat T-50-06).
* **One plain-string alias per field.** Pydantic's multi-alias form — the one that offers a
  list of candidate spellings — is never emitted, and this module contains no mention of it
  by name so that ``grep`` over this file is an honest check rather than one the
  explanation defeats. arrowmodel's ``ArrowModelConverter.__init__`` raises
  ``NotImplementedError`` for it before either conversion path is reachable, and Semolina's
  own ``_has_unsupported_alias`` refuses it at the pre-check for the same reason — so a
  generated DTO that emitted one would be rejected on its first use. The generated DTO is
  therefore pinned to the
  backend it was probed against and says so in its provenance header (the corrected D-04,
  D-07). See ``50-RESEARCH.md`` R-01 for the measured table.
* **Every metric annotation is ``T | None``** (D-09), applied through
  :func:`semolina.codegen.python_renderer.metric_annotation` and never written inline here.
  That helper is the one place 47-DECISIONS Decision 2 lives, and ``semolina codegen
  --check`` decorates probed annotations through the same call — two copies would let a
  generated DTO and a drift report disagree about nullability. COUNT never returns NULL and
  is annotated ``int | None`` regardless: the over-approximation is deliberate and
  documented (47-DECISIONS Decision 2), because the two errors are not symmetric. A
  too-wide annotation is an unnecessary ``| None`` in a user's type checker; a too-narrow
  one is a live bug, putting a ``None`` into a non-Optional field on Phase 49's fast path
  and raising ``ValidationError`` under ``validate=True``.

A probe failure is fatal here. ``annotation_check._probe_view`` can afford a broad
``except Exception`` because it degrades to warehouse metadata; DTO codegen has no metadata
route, so degrading would mean emitting an empty or guessed DTO instead of an error.
