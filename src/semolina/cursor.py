    DBAPI 2.0 cursor wrapper with Row convenience methods.

    Wraps any DBAPI 2.0-compatible cursor via delegation. Adds
    fetchall_rows(), fetchmany_rows(), and fetchone_row() methods
    that convert DBAPI tuples to Row objects.

    A result is read one way. The first read picks it: the DBAPI fetches (``fetchone``,
    ``fetchmany``, ``fetchall`` and their ``_rows`` variants, which interleave freely),
    ``for row in cursor``, ``fetch_record_batch()``, ``iter_into()``, or one of the
    whole-result methods. Reading it a second way raises
    :class:`~semolina.exceptions.SemolinaResultConsumedError` naming both calls, because the
    second would start after whatever the first had buffered and silently miss those rows.

    Every way of reading rows needs pyarrow, because ADBC reads through a pyarrow reader;
    each raises :class:`~semolina.exceptions.SemolinaMissingDependencyError` without it. The
    one exception is ``fetch_polars()``.

        ADBC's implementation *takes* the cursor's Arrow stream handle and leaves ``None``
        behind, so calling ``fetch_polars()`` twice reaches the driver's own
        ``ProgrammingError("Result set has been closed or consumed")``. Reading ``description``
        first is safe; it does not import the stream.

        A ``DECIMAL`` metric keeps its precision and its type: polars 1.43.2 gives a warehouse
        ``decimal128(38, 2)`` column a native ``Decimal(precision=38, scale=2)`` dtype holding
        ``decimal.Decimal`` values, measured on this project's own type-fidelity probe. That is
        better than ``fetch_df()``, where the same column falls back to an untyped ``object``
        dtype. One condition, recorded because it is reachable in principle and not in
        practice: polars was measured raising a Rust ``PanicException`` on a ``decimal256``
        column, and no backend Semolina supports has been observed producing one — a Snowflake
        ``NUMBER`` stops at precision 38, and Databricks and DuckDB decimals stop there too.

        Returns:

        Convert the whole result into a list of Pydantic model instances.

        Columns are matched to fields by name, resolved through arrowmodel's own key rule —
        ``validation_alias``, then ``alias``, then the field name. Result columns the model
        does not declare are ignored, so one DTO can serve several queries. A declared field
        with no matching column is an error unless it carries a default.

        Any Pydantic ``BaseModel`` subclass works; inheriting from ``arrowmodel.ArrowModel``
        is not required and buys nothing here.

        ``validate`` selects between two coherent behaviours, and the schema check follows it
        (see :func:`semolina.dto.check_result_schema`):

        - ``validate=False`` (default) — **types must match.** Instances are built with
          ``model_construct``, which converts nothing, so an annotation that disagreed with
          its column would leave a wrong-typed value sitting in the field. The structural
          check runs before any row moves and raises
          :class:`~semolina.exceptions.SemolinaSchemaMismatchError` instead, naming every offending
          field at once. Nothing is coerced; nothing is per-value; the cost is one schema
          comparison.
        - ``validate=True`` — **types are coerced.** Pydantic's full pipeline runs per row at
          roughly 2-5x the cost, converting where it legally can (``decimal128`` into a
          ``float`` field, ``int64`` into ``float``) and raising ``ValidationError`` where it
          cannot (``decimal128`` into ``int``). The structural type comparison is skipped,
          because Pydantic owns the decision and refusing first would block narrowings that
          work.

        Column *presence* is checked on both settings — a required field with no matching
        column is an error either way, since no amount of coercion invents a column.

        Reads the whole result, like ``fetch_arrow_table()``, so any other way of reading the
        same cursor afterwards raises :class:`~semolina.exceptions.SemolinaResultConsumedError`.

        """
        Stream the result as Pydantic model instances, one at a time.

        The streaming sibling of :meth:`into`. Instances are produced individually, but
        conversion happens a whole Arrow batch at a time: consuming one instance pulls exactly
        one batch from the underlying reader, so a result larger than memory is never
        materialized. Column matching, alias resolution and the treatment of extra or
        defaulted fields are identical to :meth:`into` — only the delivery differs.

        **The schema check happens at the call, not on first iteration.** ``iter_into`` is a
        plain method that validates and then returns a generator, rather than a generator
        function whose body would not run until the first ``next()``. That distinction is the
        whole point: arrowmodel's own ``Model.iter(batch)`` is a generator function, so a bad
        DTO handed to it returns quietly and blows up several frames away, inside whatever
        loop or comprehension eventually consumed it. Here a mismatched DTO raises on the
        ``iter_into(...)`` expression itself, with the traceback pointing at the line that
        named the wrong type, and before any reader is created or any batch moves.

        The returned iterator is this cursor's way of reading its result: any other way,
        :meth:`fetch_record_batch` included, then raises
        :class:`~semolina.exceptions.SemolinaResultConsumedError`. The cursor must also outlive
        the iterator: consume it inside the context manager (or
        before ``close()``). See arrow-adbc issue #1893.

        Args:
            model: The Pydantic model to build. Any ``type[BaseModel]``.
            validate: Run Pydantic validation per row instead of the fast path. Set on the
                converter once and reused for every batch. Defaults to False. Read
                :meth:`into`'s note first — ``validate=True`` coerces instead of
                requiring exact types.

        Returns:
            An ``Iterator`` yielding one ``model`` instance per result row. Empty for a
            zero-row result; zero-row batches mid-stream are skipped rather than ending it.

        Raises:
            SemolinaMissingDependencyError: If pyarrow or arrowmodel is not installed. Raised
                at the call.
            SemolinaSchemaMismatchError: If the model's annotations do not describe the
                result schema. Raised at the call.
            SemolinaResultConsumedError: If the result is already being read another way.
            pydantic.ValidationError: Under ``validate=True`` only, for a value Pydantic
                cannot convert to its declared annotation — a NULL in a non-optional field
                being the common one. Raised from the batch that carries the value, not at
                the call, since no value has been read yet when the call returns.
            TypeError: From arrowmodel, for a field annotated ``dict`` or ``Mapping`` against
                an Arrow ``map`` column. Raised on the first ``next()``.
            ValueError: From arrowmodel, naming a required column it could not find. The
                check above pre-empts this whenever it has a schema to read, so it survives
                only where ``description`` was ``None``. Raised on the first ``next()``.
