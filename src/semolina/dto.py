"""
Structural pre-check between a result schema and a Pydantic DTO's field annotations.

This is how ``.into(DTO)`` satisfies DTO-03. arrowmodel's fast path builds instances with
``model_construct`` and performs no per-value validation, so a ``decimal128`` column landing
in a ``float``-annotated field produces a quietly wrong value and raises nothing. Its
validated path does something worse for the case this project cares most about: it *coerces*
the ``Decimal`` to a ``float``, losing the precision, and also raises nothing. So the check
below is not a nicety layered on top of arrowmodel — on a money column it is the only
mechanism in Semolina that catches the mismatch, on either setting of ``validate=``.

**Schema only. No rows.** The check reads ``cursor.description``, which the driver has
already resolved: it fetches nothing, issues no query, and creates no reader. That is also
what lets the async cursor's ``iter_into`` stay a plain method rather than a coroutine.

**No row value ever reaches a report.** A mismatch names field names, column names, Arrow
type names and Python type names — never data. The check has no values to leak by
construction, and that must stay true of anything added here.

**Confident verdicts only.** A mismatch is reported when *both* sides reduce to a class or a
union of classes. Everything else — :data:`typing.Any`, an Arrow type
:func:`~semolina.codegen.arrow_map.arrow_type_to_runtime_type` does not map, a
``TypeAliasType`` such as :data:`pydantic.JsonValue`, a bare ``Annotated``, an unreduceable
parameterised generic — passes silently with no verdict. DTO-03 asks for "an error rather
than a silently wrong-typed value", not for a second type checker, and every false positive
here is a call site that worked yesterday.

Nothing is imported from :mod:`semolina.codegen.annotation_check`, despite the family
resemblance of the report shape. That comparator is string-against-string over a *textually
parsed* committed model and is driven by a live probe; every one of its inputs is absent at
``.into()`` time.

    converted fine.

    Matching is exact :class:`str` equality against the Arrow field name: no case folding, no

    Raise if a DTO does not describe the result schema.

    Reads only ``cursor.description`` — a list of DBAPI 7-tuples whose second element an ADBC
    cursor fills with a ``pyarrow.DataType``. No rows are fetched and no query is issued.

    The check has two halves, and they are gated separately because they answer different
    questions.

    **Column presence — always checked.** Result columns the DTO does not declare are ignored,
    so one DTO can serve several queries and a query can gain a column without breaking
    existing DTOs. A declared field with no matching column is an error only when the field is
    required: a field carrying a default (including ``= None``) is honoured as "optional in
    the result", which is also exactly where arrowmodel itself draws the line. A missing
    column is never a coercion decision, so no caller opts out of it — and Semolina's message
    names the field, the column key and what the result actually carried, where arrowmodel's
    own ``ValueError`` names only the column.

    **Type compatibility — only when ``check_types``.** This half is skipped under
    ``validate=True``, where Pydantic performs the conversion per value and raises
    ``ValidationError`` on a pair it cannot convert. Running both would mean refusing
    conversions that the validated path performs correctly: a ``decimal128`` column into a
    ``float`` field is a deliberate, working narrowing under ``validate=True``, and only a
    silent wrong-typed value under the fast path, which is exactly what this half catches
    there.

    Every mismatch is reported together in one error rather than one at a time. The whole
    schema is in hand up front, so listing them all costs nothing and saves a
    fix-one-field-and-rerun cycle per field.

    Args:
        description: A cursor's ``description``, or ``None`` on a cursor that has not
            executed. ``None`` returns without a verdict, the same defensive handling
            ``SemolinaCursor._column_names`` uses.
        model: The Pydantic model ``.into()`` was asked for. Any ``BaseModel`` subclass;
            inheriting from ``arrowmodel.ArrowModel`` is not required.
        check_types: Compare each field's annotation against its column's Arrow type. Pass
            ``False`` when the caller runs ``validate=True``, so Pydantic owns type
            enforcement and may coerce. Column presence is checked either way.

    Raises:
        SemolinaSchemaMismatchError: If a field is required and absent from the result, or —
            when ``check_types`` — reduces to a comparable type that disagrees with its
