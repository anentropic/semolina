"""
Measure a semantic-view field's type along three independent routes and render the comparison.

This module is deliberately **not** a test module: its name matches none of pytest's
``python_files`` patterns, so pytest imports it for doctest collection only (the same way it
imports ``tests/models.py``). It is driven by ``just type-fidelity``
(``uv run python tests/type_fidelity_probe.py --write``) and read by the guards in
``tests/unit/test_type_fidelity_table.py``.

The module is split into two regions that must never be allowed to converge:

* the **metadata half** — :func:`measure_duckdb`'s use of ``Engine.introspect`` and the raw
  ``DESCRIBE SELECT * FROM semantic_view(...)`` statement. Its mapped-annotation column is
  produced by ``semolina.codegen.type_map``, which is exactly the thing being measured;
* the **result half** — :func:`probe_schema`. It must never import
  ``semolina.codegen.type_map`` or any symbol from it. Its values come from the driver's own
  Arrow schema and from ``pyarrow``'s conversion of that schema to Python objects.

Two columns sourced from one place would make the comparison circular, and a comparison that
cannot produce a mismatch is not measuring anything. That is the failure this probe exists to
rule out; ``tests/unit/test_type_fidelity_table.py`` enforces it.

Record/replay contract: the DuckDB probe runs **live, in-process**, against an in-memory
DuckDB. It records nothing and must never be routed through pytest-adbc-replay cassette
interception — ``adbc_auto_patch`` lists ``adbc_driver_manager.dbapi``, which DuckDB also
routes through, so a cassette marker would silently divert it into replay *and* normalise its
SQL as the Databricks dialect.

Semantic view over :data:`PROBE_TABLE_DDL`.

The seven metrics here and :data:`DUCKDB_PROBE_METRICS` must stay in step — a metric declared
here and not emitted is a gap nothing else would make visible. Metric names deliberately
differ from the underlying column names: the ``semantic_views`` extension rejects a metric
that collides with a dimension or column name.

``region_list`` is the only metric here that is not an arithmetic aggregate. It exists so the
view always carries at least one field the type map has no entry for: ``list(o.region)``
describes as ``VARCHAR[]``, which stays a ``TODO:`` annotation for the whole of Phase 48. It
is what
``tests/unit/test_type_fidelity_duckdb.py::test_an_unmapped_type_still_disagrees_by_value``

columns agree. Replacing it with a mapped type would leave that guard nothing to assert.
