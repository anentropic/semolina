"""
Tests that cancellation reaches the DuckDB driver and the pool recovers (ASYNC-06).

ASYNC-06 is delivered entirely upstream: adbc-poolhouse's ``cancellable_offload``
parks a watcher on an event while the worker thread blocks in the driver, fires
``adbc_cancel`` from inside a shield when the surrounding scope is cancelled,
invalidates the aborted connection for poison recovery, and re-raises the
framework cancellation rather than the driver's own interrupt error. Semolina
writes none of that. What Semolina can still break is *transparency* — a
``try/except Exception`` would let the cancellation past unnoticed, and a
``try/except BaseException`` that logged and returned would eat it — so these
tests are the executed proof that its frames stay transparent.

The coverage is split by risk, because the parts fail differently.

The **deterministic** tests carry the slot-release and no-masking-teardown
assertions with no timing involved at all, so they can never be flaky. Most
cancel the scope before the call, so the first checkpoint inside it observes an
already-pending cancellation. One cancels *during* the statement instead, which
is where ``aexecute``'s check-in arm lives: a cancellation observed at the first
checkpoint has not yet checked a connection out, so it cannot show that a
connection already taken comes back.

The **long-query** tests are the half that has to prove the *driver* was reached
rather than that the client merely stopped waiting. A test that greened while
the warehouse query kept running would certify abandonment, which is the exact
outcome ASYNC-06 exists to rule out — on a metered warehouse the cost keeps
accruing after the user is gone. So the query is measurably expensive, its
uncancelled duration is measured rather than assumed, the deadline is set an
order of magnitude below that measurement, and the abort is proven by the
cancelled call returning in a small fraction of the uncancelled duration. If the
measurement cannot clear the floor even at the top of the cost ladder, the tests
skip with the number they measured. An honest skip beats a race.

That last assertion needs an interruptible statement, and on DuckDB Semolina's
own generated SQL is not one. Measured here: ``adbc_cancel`` fired 0.3s into a
3.0s aggregate aborts plain SQL at 0.32s, but the identical aggregate wrapped in
the ``semantic_views`` community extension's ``semantic_view()`` table function
runs the full 3.4s and only *then* reports ``INTERRUPT Error``. The extension's
inner query does not observe the outer interrupt flag. That is a property of the
DuckDB test substrate, not of Semolina or of adbc-poolhouse, and the warehouses
Semolina targets cancel server-side. So the two claims are split across two
tests: :class:`TestCancellationReachesTheDriver` carries the abort-landed-early
claim over an interruptible statement, and
:class:`TestCancellationThroughAexecute` carries the transparency and
pool-recovery claims over the real ``aexecute`` path, without pretending to show
an early abort it cannot show.

Cassettes cannot cover any of this: ``ReplayCursor.adbc_cancel()`` is a
deliberate no-op and replay returns instantly, so nothing can ever land
mid-flight. A real driver is required.

Test classes:
- TestDeterministicCancellation: timing-free cancel propagation and slot release
- TestCancellationReachesTheDriver: the abort lands in the driver, mid-query
- TestCancellationThroughAexecute: aexecute stays transparent, pool recovers

    distinguishes an abort that reached the driver from one that did not: a
    query left running to completion costs its full duration on the warehouse
    whether or not the client is still listening, and a test that asserted only
    "the caller saw a cancellation" would green in both worlds.

    The statement is ordinary SQL rather than Semolina's generated
    ``semantic_view()`` call, because the ``semantic_views`` community
    extension's table function does not observe DuckDB's interrupt flag while
    its inner query runs — measured here as a full 3.4s before ``INTERRUPT
    Error`` surfaces, against 0.32s for the identical aggregate in plain SQL. It
    still runs through Semolina's async surface: ``AsyncEngine.connect()``, the

        The cancelled call returns in a fraction of the uncancelled duration.

        at one tenth leaves a fivefold margin — a gap far too wide to be a race,
        and the only observable proof the warehouse stopped working.

        The expected exception is the framework's cancellation, *not* DuckDB's
        ``INTERRUPT Error``. poolhouse swallows the driver's interrupt on the
