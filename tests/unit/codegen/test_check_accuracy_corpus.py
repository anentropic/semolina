"""
The ``--check`` accuracy corpus, one test per case.

Every case comes from ``.planning/research/2026-09-30-CHECK-ACCURACY.md``. Each test asserts
the outcome ``--check`` *should* give. Plan 55-05 added the cases that failed then as strict
``xfail`` tests, so decision D9 could judge each alternative by which cases it turned green;
plan 55-06 implemented D9 and removed each marker as its case went green. Three cases are
limitations D9 accepts (M10, D3 and D5, recorded in
``.planning/research/2026-10-15-D9-DECISION.md``). Each is a test that asserts the
limitation, so a change to it is a decision rather than an accident.

Cases M7 and M8 are not here. They are GEN-09 (an untyped ``Metric()`` compared with
``Any | None``, and a check that never probed exiting 0) and are tested where that fix lands.

Both commands are driven through their CLI ``_run_check`` functions rather than through the
reader and the comparison separately. The cases are about what a user sees, an exit code,
and the fix may move work between the reader and the comparison. A test pinned to today's
seam would have to be rewritten by the very change it is meant to judge.

Record/replay contract: the model half runs live, in-process, against the in-memory DuckDB
probe view, and must never carry ``pytest.mark.adbc_cassette`` (see
``tests/unit/codegen/test_annotation_check.py``'s module docstring). The DTO half needs no
warehouse: ``ProbedQuery`` carries a hand-written schema.
