Statement prefixes whose rows are catalogue metadata, not view data.

``engine.introspect()`` reads its field list from ``DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW`` /
``DESCRIBE SELECT`` (DuckDB), ``SHOW COLUMNS`` (Snowflake) and ``DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED``
(Databricks), and fetching those rows is what introspection *is* — the generation path has
always done it. TYPE-07's guarantee is about the view's **data**, so the guard has to draw
the line here rather than ban ``fetchall`` outright.

    """
    Make any fetch from a non-metadata statement raise.

    Wraps ``adbc_driver_manager.dbapi.Cursor``: ``execute`` records the statement it ran, and
    the fetch methods refuse when that statement is not catalogue introspection. A
    ``--check`` run under this guard therefore proves it never materialized a row of the
    view's data, rather than asserting it in prose.

    ``fetch_record_batch`` is wrapped differently from the other four. The zero-row fallback
    calls it and then reads only ``reader.schema``, so refusing the call itself would break
    the very route the guard most needs to cover — the only route Databricks can take, and
    the one Snowflake takes when parameters are bound. The reader it returns is proxied
    instead: schema yes, batches no.
